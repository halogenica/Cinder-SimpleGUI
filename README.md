NOTICE: I used this fork to do some little changes like removing namespaces in headers files (to avoid getting ambiguous calls to WindowRef when using Quicktime on MacOS) and printing values of sliders next to their label. Those changes will hopefully be backported so I can close this repo again. -- Benni Graf.

SimpleGUI is a cinder block for creating minimalist GUIs. It is branched from the MowaLibs cinder implementation from Marcin Ignac, which is based off of controlIP5 for processing written by Andreas Schlegel. It has been branched here since the original repository doesn't appear to be accepting pull requests and has fallen out of date.
